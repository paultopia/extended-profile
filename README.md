# extended-profile
I hate github profiles.  Ergo, here's an extension.

1.  Wouldn't it be nice if github had a link to one's gists on one's profile page?  Here you go: [paultopia gists](https://gist.github.com/paultopia).
2.  Wouldn't it be nice if github clearly (i.e., other than with a small-font note buried under the title) distinguished between one's own repos and forks of others on the main profile page?  My own repos: [quizzer](https://github.com/paultopia/quizzer), [notes-to-evernote](https://github.com/paultopia/notes-to-evernote), [code-data-lawstudents](https://github.com/paultopia/code-data-lawstudents), [simplerandomassign](https://github.com/paultopia/simpleRandomAssign), [memnames](https://github.com/paultopia/memNames), [rotate](https://github.com/paultopia/rotate), [quickcite --only half-started](https://github.com/paultopia/quickcite), [stray-cites](https://github.com/paultopia/stray-cites), [rol_simulation](https://github.com/paultopia/rol_simulation), and [a crap working repo](https://github.com/paultopia/paultopia-working).
3.  [And a link to my personal webpage again](http://paul-gowder.com).
